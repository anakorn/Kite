      "description": "Hey guys,\nWhen we came back from retreat, we found out one of the college student's (Kevin Kim) cars got towed from the side lot. It really sucks and the bill was also very expensive. \nAs a church this is an opportunity display the love that we have for each other because of the love that Christ showed us on the cross.  We are asking for donations of $5-10 or whatever you can give to help pay for the cost of retrieving his towed car. \nI will be collecting the $ next Friday and Sunday. Thanks all!\n\nGalatians 12:24-26\nBut God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 25that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.",

      "description": "Jodaiko is a Collegiate Taiko group based on the main campus of the University of California, Irvine. We will be having a Spring Concert entitled \"Henka\" which translates to \"change\" but in the context of how Jodaiko has changed over the years (from the very beginning, the present, and to what it will become in the future). \"Change\" is much too broad to accurately portray the many years that Jodaiko has experienced. To be more precise, \"Henka\" describes the natural transformations of Jodaiko. How we operate, how we perform, and what we perform are all factors that play into the definition of Jodaiko, a definition that is fluid and ever changing.\n\nLast year's concert celebrated our twenty years of existence. This year, we hope to portray the future of Jodaiko by showcasing remixes of older songs and new songs. Remixed versions of past Jodaiko repertoire and concert songs reveal the differences in our playing style. New songs display the creative minds and forward shift of Jodaiko, as every year gives rise to new generations and new ideas. Henka serves to present the transformations that Jodaiko has undergone, as well as to depict how we are always exploring, transitioning, and growing.\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nDoors open at 7:00PM\nShow starts at 7:30PM\nShow ends at 9:30PM\n\nTickets:\n$10 | Student\n$15 | General\n$17 | At the door\n\nTickets can now be purchased from the following page.\nhttp://henka.brownpapertickets.com/\n\nFor those driving, Mesa Parking Structure is the closest available area.\nLocated at:\n4002 Mesa Rd \nIrvine 92617\nRates will range from $4-$10.\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nLike us on Fb:\nhttp://on.fb.me/W41NDs\nWatch our promo video on Youtube: \nhttp://bit.ly/WKyJ1l\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://bit.ly/WWL3eL\n\nVisit us at:\nhttp://www.jodaiko.com\n\nFor more information, e-mail: henka2013@gmail.com\n\n**Note: The concert is on a Wednesday and will be in the evening**",

      "description": "AHUA is excited to present On the Wall on Thursday, February 28th 2013, an art show composed of artworks made by current students, professors, and Friends of Art History!\n\nWe invite you to contribute your artwork to our exhibit by submitting your answer to the question “What is Art?” Your work will be exhibited at On The Wall at the Exhibition and Artists’ Reception from 6-8 pm on Thursday, February 28th 2013 in the Art, Culture & Technology (ACT) Room 2206, Claire Trevor School of the Arts at UCI. \n\nThe tradition of questioning art in the classroom as well as in popular culture inspired On the Wall. AHUA will adopt Marcel Duchamp’s idea of questioning the ontological, epistemological, and institutional set of arbitrary rules that construct the art world. Participants in the show will question what constitutes art and what defines an artist through the exhibition of works by both trained and untrained artists in conventional as well as unconventional mediums.\n\nIf you wish you participate, please send your RSVP to emiliemartin@live.com to reserve your spot along with jpeg photos of your submission with your full name, along with title and medium.\n\nThere are no boundaries, guidelines or limitations to what you can submit. If you would like to include a short paragraph about you or your work for the catalog, please include that with your submission. The board members will curate the show, which will include all aspects of a real art gallery or museum exhibition including an organized theme, spatial design, and a full artists’ catalog. February 15th is the deadline to submit interest and an artist's statement.\n\nThis show is another part of our ongoing effort to foster a community of art enthusiasts by sponsoring events, workshops, and museum trips. We are excited to explore this quintessential, recurring theme with you and invite you to come enjoy the exhibition even if you do not present a work of art. Keep your eyes out for updates and reminders and please do not hesitate to contact Emilie Martin with any comments or questions.",

And since it's not a good weekend for Vegas I think bar hopping in Long Beach is the next best thing!  \n\nNot sure which bar yet, but it will be in the LBC and my roommate has a mini van and can bring six people!  If not, feel free to meet us there.\n\n***WILL POST THE DETAILS AS SOON AS I KNOW***\n\nHope you all can come and share this awesome night with me :)\n\nAnd if I forgot to invite you...feel free to add yourself to the event page :) ALL are welcome",
